## Phenomenon Overview
The phenomena that has been chosen is AI generated deep fake images and videos on social
media platforms with a focused interest on labelling such content. We aim to investigate if
labelling AI generated deep fake images affects its spread and whether labelling affects user
behaviour and interactions. The AI-to-AI interactions in this phenomenon is the battle between
the AI models to detect AI generated content and the AI bots creating such content and posting
them. Major social media platforms such as Meta and Instagram have taken the initiative to label
these AI-generated images and videos for transparency. (Meta, 2024) We can see this is a present
issue and one that has such large platforms working on tackling.
