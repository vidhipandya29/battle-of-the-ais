## Ground Rules
These define what group members expect from one another and what norms they agree on relating to behaviours and actions. Below are examples of the types of areas it is important to address and examples of what form they might take.

| Area         | Principles & Norms |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **Communication** | - Use Discord for communication  <br> - Reply within 24 hours  <br> - Use Zoom for group conversations and meetings  <br> - Everyone contributes their ideas and opinions for the project  <br> - Be respectful when problem-solving and collaborating  <br> - Ensure effective communication regarding one's progress on group work |
| **Meetings** | - Weekly Meetings (Saturday, 10am) on Zoom  <br> - Collaborate on Google Docs for sharing and organizing ideas  <br> - Be punctual and attend meetings  <br> - Create action items at the end of each meeting |
| **Deadlines** | - Complete tasks before the deadline  <br> - If circumstances result in potential delay, communicate this to other members |

**Care Statement**
| Outline here how the team will strive to care for the health of each other and the team as a whole during the project duration: |
|-----------------------------------------------|

| - Be mindful of each other’s schedules and academic workload |
| - In case of personal emergencies, members will notify the team for task redistribution |

## Performance Agreement
Considers how the group will address non-performance of what is agreed to. Whatever the group agrees upon should correspond to the impact or gravity of the issues at hand.
- Members will hold each other accountable for completing tasks
- If a member has issue with completing the workload to communicate so in advanced
- If a member fails to contribute without reason, the group will address concerns in a meeting


## Signatures to the Agreement
