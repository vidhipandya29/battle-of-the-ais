## Phenomena of Interest  
The phenomena of interest will be focused on AI generated deep fake images and videos with a focused interest on the spread of how such content is initially created to the eventual detection and labelling as AI generated content. The AI-to-AI interaction that this displays is a bot vs. bot dynamic. The first bot is responsible for creating and sharing content that imitates individuals of influence without consent. The second bot detects AI-generated content and labels it across social media platforms for clarity with users. The content is interacted with the users on social media platforms and this interaction aids in the spread of the AI generated content. The race lies between the initial post of the content as it is shared on the platform to its detection, striving for quick detection as to  properly inform users of the type of content they are interacting with. These AI-generation and AI-detection tools exist within several large social media platforms such as Instagram and Meta. As AI-based content is rapidly increasing, the ethical implications of deepfakes and non consensual imitation through photos and videos raise concern.
